🧩 NIGHTMARE — Reverse Engineering Challenge Write-Up

Category: Reverse Engineering
Flag format: SECE{...}

The challenge description says:

A door opens into silence. Every step forward triggers something unseen. Only those who refuse to give up reach the end.

From the start, this hints at hidden traps, misleading paths, and the need to push past fake solutions.

🔍 Step 1 — Initial Inspection

The first thing I did was run basic analysis on the binary:

file chall
strings chall


This immediately revealed several suspicious “flags” inside the file:

SECE{f4k3_fl4g_try_h4rd3r}
SECE{n0t_th3_r34l_0n3}
SECE{y0u_g0t_tr1ck3d_l0l}
SECE{B1N4RY_P4TCH1NG_1S_345Y}
SECE{N4N7RY_P5TCH4NG_IS_N9T_T03_


Clearly, the binary was packed with decoys designed to waste time.

🧠 Step 2 — Finding the Hidden Message

One string stood out:

N4N7RY_P5TCH4NG_IS_N9T_T03_


After converting the leetspeak:

4 → A

7 → T

5 → S

9 → O

0 → O

3 → E

It becomes:

BINARY_PATCHING_IS_NOT_TOO_


Later in memory, the program appends:

34SY  →  EASY


So the full message is:

BINARY_PATCHING_IS_NOT_TOO_EASY

In leetspeak flag format:

SECE{B1N4RY_P4TCH1NG_IS_N0T_T00_34SY}


At this point it was clear the challenge revolves
