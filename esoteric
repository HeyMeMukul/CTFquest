An innocuous hacker’s photo, uploaded anonymously to a public album, appears utterly ordinary at first glance—yet seasoned analysts suspect
it harbors deeply nested secrets waiting to be uncovered. Dont leave anything in this challenge (description, title,etc..) u may need it..
This is a fun challenge ->SECE{giffa itach zillo zillo mittai ou varal mittai zillo chou jit itach monk} FLAG format : SECE{xx_xx}


1. Unzip images.zip with password - esoteric (as mentioned in the description that title will help)
2. Explore the metadata :
      The middle section of that ID is a sequence of Hexadecimal values separated by dots. If we take the hex values 63.72.40.63.6b.5f.6d.33, they translate from Hex to ASCII as:

                                  63 -> c
                                  
                                  72 -> r
                                  
                                  40 -> a (actually @, but often used for 'a' in leetspeak)
                                  
                                  63 -> c
                                  
                                  6b -> k
                                  
                                  5f -> _
                                  
                                  6d -> m
                                  
                                  33 -> 3
                                  
                                  Combined, this spells cr@ck_m3

3. and use " cr@ck_m3 " as password for steghide --extract -sf images.jpeg
