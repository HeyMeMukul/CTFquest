1. Challenge Overview
The Narrative:
"A holiday lover shared a square-framed picture from the rainy green hills of Kerala, posing proudly with a huge tusked friend while carrying a fancy camera bag. An old colonial-era wooden cottage stands behind him in the shot that was built by British."
The Hint:
"No encoding, No cipher, just observe the proper noun of old stufffss!"


2. Reconnaissance & Analysis

Step A: Analyzing Visual Evidence
Nikon Gear: The image shows a Nikon camera bag. The description mentions a "fancy camera bag," confirming the person in the story is a photographer.
The Pouch: The laptop sleeve has a Theyyam motif. Theyyam is a famous ritual art form of North Kerala (specifically Kannur and Wayanad districts). This narrows down the "rainy green hills" search to Northern Kerala.
Laptop Screen: The screen shows a CTF platform (Traboda/InCTF style), indicating this is a challenge related to Indian cybersecurity communities.


Step B: Decoding the Narrative
"Rainy green hills of Kerala": Points to Wayanad, known for its lush forests and high rainfall.
"Huge tusked friend": This is a classic reference to an elephant. In tourist spots, this usually means a life-size statue.
"Old colonial-era wooden cottage built by British": This is the primary target. We need to find a British-era wooden structure in Wayanad near an elephant statue.

3. Investigation & OSINT Path

Search Query 1: "Elephant statue British wooden cottage Kerala hills"
Searching for tourism landmarks in Wayanad led to the Muthanga Wildlife Sanctuary. At the entrance of Muthanga, there is a famous life-size elephant statue where tourists frequently take "square-framed" (Instagram style) photos.

Search Query 2: "Muthanga British wooden building"
Checking the history of the Muthanga range, I found references to a unique heritage structure located right there. It is a two-story forest guest house built entirely of wood by the British in the early 1900s.

Step C: Identifying the "Proper Noun"
The hint says to look for the "proper noun of old stufffss."
In Kerala's architectural history, especially in the Wayanad/Malabar region, traditional wooden houses or colonial log houses have a specific local name.

Researching the specific building at Muthanga reveals it is famously known as the "Cerambi" (or Muthanga Cerambi).
Linguistic Check: In Malayalam, Cerambi (ചെരമ്പി) refers to a wooden granary or a traditional wooden structure used for storage/stay.

Historical Fit: The Muthanga Cerambi is a celebrated colonial-era wooden "cottage" that matches every detail of the description.


4. Final Solution
The "proper noun" for the old colonial wooden structure is Cerambi.
Flag: cerambi (or MUTHANGA_CERAMBI)
