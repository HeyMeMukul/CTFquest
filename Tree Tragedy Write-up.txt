Challenge Write-up: Tree Tragedy
This challenge is a forensic and OSINT-based puzzle centered around one of the most mysterious criminal cases in modern Indian history: the Burari Deaths (2018).

1. Analysis of the Artifacts
The Photograph (rep.jpg): The image depicts a Banyan tree with prominent aerial roots. In the context of the "Tree Tragedy," this is a visual metaphor for the "Badh Tapasya" (Banyan Tree Penance). The family involved in the incident believed that by hanging in a specific formation, they would resemble the hanging roots of a Banyan tree, leading to their salvation.

The Diary (voice.jpg): This is a crucial piece of evidence. The handwriting is in Hindi and contains specific ritualistic instructions. Some key phrases translated include:

"Badh puja lagatar karni hai" (The Banyan tree ritual must be done continuously).

"Chunni ya saari ka prayog" (Use of stoles or sarees).

"Haath prarthana ki mudra mein" (Hands in a prayer position).

"Aankho par patti" (Blindfolds on the eyes).

2. Identifying the Case
By searching for keywords like "11 family members," "Banyan tree ritual," and "diaries found in house," the search leads directly to the Burari mass suicide/accidental death case.

In 2018, 11 members of the Chundawat family were found dead in their home in Delhi. The investigation revealed that the youngest son, Lalit Bhatia, had been claiming for over a decade that he was receiving instructions from a "voice."

3. Finding the Source of the Voice
According to the diaries and family testimony, Lalit Bhatia claimed that the spirit of his deceased father was communicating through him. He would often enter a trance-like state where his voice would change, and he would dictate instructions to the family as if he were his father.

The "voice" that the entire family obeyed, leading to the tragedy, belonged to the patriarch: Bhopal Singh.
